   About
   </h1>
   <p>
      Hello my name is Luis Jimenez and I love creating things.<br>
      I not only created this website, but the projects which are also documented here as well.<br>
      What I love most about the creative process is the puzzle-solving aspect of it.<br>
      Be sure to check out my Lego Ideas page, the video game I designed, and my linkedin for commisions!<br>

   Project #1: Godzilla
   </h2>

   <p1>
I found the lack of an official Lego Godzilla disturbing. So I decided to do something about it.<br>
To begin with I chose to take inspiration from the Godzilla design as he appeared in Godzilla: King <br>
of the Monsters. After I ordered the pieces, I built it and took pictures of him to upload on the <br>
Lego Ideas Project above!
